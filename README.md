# Formal Verification of Blockchain Protocols for Security

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for my master's thesis titled:

**Formal Verification of Blockchain Protocols for Security**  
*Case Studies on Sui and REVM Using Rocq*

## Overview

The thesis focuses on the application of **formal verification** techniques to blockchain protocols to ensure their correctness, reliability, and security. Using **Rocq**, an advanced version of Coq, the thesis explores:

- Verification of **Sui**'s smart contract execution logic.
- Formal modeling and verification of **REVM (Rust Ethereum Virtual Machine)**.
- Theoretical frameworks and practical methodologies for applying formal verification in blockchain ecosystems.

## Structure

- **`thesis.tex`**: The main LaTeX file for the thesis document.
- **`aaltothesis.cls`**: Aalto University's official LaTeX class file for formatting.
- **`figures/`**: Directory containing diagrams and visualizations used in the thesis.
